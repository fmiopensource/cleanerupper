Cleanerupper
============

Cleanerupper can be used in any ActiveRecord based model to seamless clean, sanitize, and
remove inappropriate or sensitive data.


Examples
=======

class Widget < ActiveRecord::Base
  #The primary use of CleanerUpper is to be used as
  #before_save filters.

  #This will scramble the data before it is saved:
  scramble :body, :title

  #This will remove the data before it is saved:
  remove :body, :title

  #This will replace the data before it is saved:
  replace :body, :title

  #You can also define a block if you are using multiple
  #different cleaning methods:
  cleaner do |c|
    c.scramble :body
    c.remove :title
    c.replace :author_name
  end
end

#You can also manually invoke the cleaning methods on an
#instance of any ActiveRecord object like so:
w = Widget.last
w.clean(:body)
w.scramble(:title)
w.remove(:author_name)
